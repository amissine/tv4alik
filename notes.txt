The mvp branch will introduce the 'Trades' and 'Buckets' drawings. Why mvp? For a
starting point:

    https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html
 
Interface IChart presents a UI for the whole chart. Instances of IDraw,
each presenting a UI for a specific drawing, can be added to it. For example,

  IDraw trades = IChart.addIDraw('Trades')

An instance of IDraw can be updated/redrawn when more market feed becomes
available:

  trades.feed(IMarketFeed)
